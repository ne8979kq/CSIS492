Java card game of 99.

This JavaFX application runs the card game portion of the project. It is the GUI associated with it.
The user logs in or signs up if they don't have an account, then the screen changes to the card game. The user is prompted
  to start the game, after which the card game commences.
  
Currently, the game almost functions as intended. There are a few bugs to work out, i.e. duplicate cards, pauses between plays,
  the computer AI aspect, etc.
